03/18/14
--------
*DONE* change TimerButton to use CountdownTimer instead of a Handler and Runnable.
*DONE* Add single ProgressBar to each button layout
    -- temporary until TimerButtons themselves can be animated
*DONE* Make TimerButtons update the ProgressBar in their CountdownTimer's onTick method
*DONE* make TimerButtons inherit from ProgressBar instead of Button

03/19/14
--------
*DONE* add color fill animation to timerButtons
    -- 03/17/14 - This should be easy to do if I change TimerButton to inherit from ProgressBar
                instead of Button. However, ProgressBars have a maxHeight that is too small and
                causes problems with the layout. This appears to be defined in a style. I should be
                able to define a new style and apply it to the TimerButton which would allow me to
                use ProgressBars but shape them like Buttons.

*DONE* implement single bar screen
*DONE* make timerButton base class
